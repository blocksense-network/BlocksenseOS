# BlocksenseOS Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies, procedures, and best practices for the BlocksenseOS project. BlocksenseOS is a confidential computing platform that requires the highest levels of security throughout its development, deployment, and operation.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Redundant security measures
- Fail-safe defaults

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
- Verify all components and communications
- Assume breach scenarios
- Least privilege access

### 3. Supply Chain Security
- Comprehensive dependency scanning
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- Signed builds and artifacts

### 4. Reproducible Security
- Deterministic builds
- Auditable processes
- Transparent security practices

## Security Controls

### Development Security

#### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: All code undergoes automated static analysis using:
  - Rust: `cargo clippy`, `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`
  - C++: `clang-static-analyzer`, `cppcheck`
  - Nix: `alejandra --check`

- **Dynamic Testing**: Runtime security testing including:
  - Memory safety validation
  - Input fuzzing
  - Property-based testing with `proptest`

- **Security Reviews**: Manual security code reviews for:
  - Cryptographic implementations
  - TEE integration points
  - Network communication protocols
  - Input validation logic

#### Supply Chain Security
- **Dependency Management**:
  - Only allow dependencies from trusted registries
  - Pin all dependencies to specific versions
  - Regular vulnerability scanning with `cargo audit`
  - License compliance checking with `cargo deny`

- **SBOM Generation**:
  - Automated generation using `syft` and `cyclonedx-bom`
  - Include all direct and transitive dependencies
  - Generate multiple formats (SPDX, CycloneDX)

#### Build Security
- **Reproducible Builds**:
  - Nix-based deterministic builds
  - Content-addressed derivations
  - Build attestation generation

- **Signed Artifacts**:
  - All release artifacts are cryptographically signed
  - Build provenance tracking
  - Verification instructions provided

### Runtime Security

#### TEE Security
- **Attestation Validation**:
  - Comprehensive TEE report verification
  - Support for SEV-SNP, TDX, and SGX
  - Certificate chain validation
  - TCB status verification

- **Cryptographic Security**:
  - Hardware-backed key generation
  - Secure random number generation
  - Constant-time cryptographic operations
  - Regular key rotation

#### Network Security
- **Input Validation**:
  - Strict input sanitization
  - Size limits enforcement
  - UTF-8 validation
  - Null byte detection

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Per-client request limits
  - Configurable time windows
  - DDoS protection

- **Connection Security**:
  - Timeout enforcement
  - Connection limits
  - Graceful degradation

### Data Security

#### Encryption
- **Data at Rest**:
  - Full disk encryption with LUKS
  - TPM-sealed encryption keys
  - Secure key derivation

- **Data in Transit**:
  - TLS for all network communications
  - Certificate validation
  - Perfect forward secrecy

- **Data in Use**:
  - TEE memory protection
  - Secure enclaves for processing
  - Memory clearing after use

## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Automated Scanning**:
  - Daily vulnerability scans with `trivy`
  - Container and filesystem scanning
  - Configuration security scanning

- **Dependency Monitoring**:
  - Continuous monitoring of dependencies
  - Automated alerts for new vulnerabilities
  - Regular dependency updates

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated and manual vulnerability detection
2. **Assessment**: Risk analysis and impact evaluation
3. **Response**: Coordinated patching and mitigation
4. **Communication**: Stakeholder notification
5. **Post-Incident**: Review and process improvement
